SCENARIO :
	   
   - One thread by process   
   - Periodic and aperiodic tasks
   - Single-call sequence
   - Unicast inter-process connexions
   - hybrid subprograms

   Code generation specific :
     - Node Location

SCENARIO_2 :
	   
   - One thread by process   
   - Periodic and aperiodic tasks
   - multiple-calls sequence
   - Unicast inter-process connexions
   - pure call sequence subprograms

   Code generation specific :
     - Node Location

SCENARIO_3 :

   - One thread by process
   - Periodic and aperiodic tasks
   - multiple-calls sequence
   - Unicast inter-process connexions
