SCENARIO :
   - Multiples threads by process   
   - Single subprogram call
   - Multicast inter-process and inter-thread out connexions (one-to-many)
   - Wait on multiple channels (C's select-like, many-to-one)
   - request priority assignement (differents)
   - IIOP communications

SCENARIO_INV :
   - requests priority are the same, so chances of requests 
     'collisions' (two request arriving to a POA at the same time)
     are higher.
   - DIOP communications
