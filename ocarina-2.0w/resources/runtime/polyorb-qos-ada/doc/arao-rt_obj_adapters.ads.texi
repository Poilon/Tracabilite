@subsubsection ARAO.RT_Obj_Adapters 


This package defines the following subprograms:

@strong{Link_To_Obj_Adapter}: This procedure performs the link between the object reference
(used by a client to send a request) and the servant who does
the job specified by the request. This procedure assumes that
the middlware is correctly set up and that a real-time object
adapter is created for that Servant (instead of for the whole
node as in ARAO.Obj_Adapter).

@example
@b{procedure }Link_To_Obj_Adapter
     (T_Object   : PolyORB.Servants.Servant_Access;
      Ref        : @b{out }PolyORB.References.Ref;
      Thread_Name : Standard.String;
      Priority   : Integer := System.Default_Priority);
@end example
