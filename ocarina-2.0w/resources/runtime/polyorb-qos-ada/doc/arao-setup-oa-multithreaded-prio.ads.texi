@subsubsection ARAO.Setup.OA.Multithreaded.Prio 
Setup an object adapter for multithread processes with request
priority management.

This package defines the following subprograms:

@strong{Initialize}: Create a Real-Time Object Adapter (RTPOA) for each IN port of
the caller process. This procedure assumes that PolyORB was
correctly setup, and particulary that PolyORB.RT_POA was
previously withed. The RTPOAs will be created with respect to
in port thread priority, stack size and number of connected out
ports.

@example
@b{procedure }Initialize;
@end example
