@subsubsection ARAO.Periodic_Threads 


This package defines the following subprograms:

@strong{Create_Periodic_Thread}: This procedure creates a periodic thread. The fact that the
thread is periodic is handled in the TP procedure. Also, we
assume that the PolyORB thread pool was properly created during
the setup phase. Storage_size 0 is default size (not really 0
bit).

@example
@b{procedure }Create_Periodic_Thread
     (TP           : Parameterless_Procedure;
      Priority     : System.Any_Priority := System.Default_Priority;
      Storage_Size : Integer := 0);
@end example
